In addition to aligned and annotated collections of bacterial and archaeal small subunit rRNA genes, RDP now includes a collection of fungal large subunit rRNA genes. RDP tools, including Classifier and Aligner, have been updated to work with this new fungal collection. The use of high-throughput sequencing to characterize environmental microbial populations has exploded in the past several years, and as sequence technologies have improved, the sizes of environmental datasets have increased. With release 11, RDP is providing an expanded set of tools to facilitate analysis of high-throughput data, including both single-stranded and paired-end reads. In addition, most tools are now available as open source packages for download and local use by researchers with high-volume needs or who would like to develop custom analysis pipelines."}}, {"model": "bioinformatics.referencedatabase", "pk": 4, "fields": {"created_by": 1, "modified_datetime": "2022-04-15T15:35:56.479Z", "created_datetime": "2022-04-15T15:35:56.479Z", "refdb_name": "PR2", "refdb_version": "v4.10.0", "refdb_slug": "pr2_v4100", "refdb_datetime": "2012-11-27T15:35:52Z", "redfb_coverage_score": "9999.00", "refdb_repo_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23193267/", "refdb_notes": "The interrogation of genetic markers in environmental meta-barcoding studies is currently seriously hindered by the lack of taxonomically curated reference data sets for the targeted genes. The Protist Ribosomal Reference database (PR(2), http://ssu-rrna.org/) provides a unique access to eukaryotic small sub-unit (SSU) ribosomal RNA and DNA sequences, with curated taxonomy. The database mainly consists of nuclear-encoded protistan sequences. However, metazoans, land plants, macrosporic fungi and eukaryotic organelles (mitochondrion, plastid and others) are also included because they are useful for the analysis of high-troughput sequencing data sets. Introns and putative chimeric sequences have been also carefully checked. Taxonomic assignation of sequences consists of eight unique taxonomic fields. In total, 136 866 sequences are nuclear encoded, 45 708 (36 501 mitochondrial and 9657 chloroplastic) are from organelles, the remaining being putative chimeric sequences. The website allows the users to download sequences from the entire and partial databases (including representative sequences after clustering at a given level of similarity). Different web tools also allow searches by sequence similarity. The presence of both rRNA and rDNA sequences, taking into account introns (crucial for eukaryotic sequences), a normalized eight terms ranked-taxonomy and updates of new GenBank releases were made possible by a long-term collaboration between experts in taxonomy and computer scientists."}}, {"model": "bioinformatics.referencedatabase", "pk": 5, "fields": {"created_by": 1, "modified_datetime": "2022-04-15T15:37:48.211Z", "created_datetime": "2022-04-15T15:37:48.211Z", "refdb_name": "UNITE", "refdb_version": "v1", "refdb_slug": "unite_v1", "refdb_datetime": "2018-10-29T15:37:44Z", "redfb_coverage_score": "9999.00", "refdb_repo_url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gky1022", "refdb_notes": "UNITE (https://unite.ut.ee/) is a web-based database and sequence management environment for the molecular identification of fungi.

These are clustered into ∼459 000 species hypotheses and assigned digital object identifiers (DOIs) to promote unambiguous reference across studies. In-house and web-based third-party sequence curation and annotation have resulted in more than 275 000 improvements to the data over the past 15 years. UNITE serves as a data provider for a range of metabarcoding software pipelines and regularly exchanges data with all major fungal sequence databases and other community resources. Recent improvements include redesigned handling of unclassifiable species hypotheses, integration with the taxonomic backbone of the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, and support for an unlimited number of parallel taxonomic classification systems."}}]
