Welcome to medna-metadata documentation!
==========================================

**medna-metadata** is a data management system for tracking environmental DNA samples from field data collection
to bioinformatics analyses.

The Sequencing and Bioinformatics Metadata project is funded through the Maine-eDNA RII Track-1 EPSCoR grant supported by
the National Science Foundation award #OIA-1849227. Maine-eDNA is a Maine coast-wide research effort to determine the
efficacy of ecosystem monitoring through environmental DNA (eDNA). For more in-depth information related to Maine-eDNA,
see the `Maine-eDNA home page <https://umaine.edu/edna/>`__. The metadata project is directly related to the goals of
`Theme 3: Macrosystem eDNA Integration <https://umaine.edu/edna/thematic-goal-3-macrosystem-edna-integration/>`__, but
also involved in `Theme 1: Sustainable Fisheries <https://umaine.edu/edna/thematic-goal-1-sustainable-fisheries/>`__ and
`Theme 2: Harmful and Shifting Species <https://umaine.edu/edna/thematic-goal-2-harmful-and-shifting-species/>`__. Our
efforts contribute to the Data Management and Data Analysis Pipeline work groups. The Sequencing and Bioinformatics
Metadata project is a collaboration between the `Coordinated Operating Research Entities (CORE) environmental DNA (eDNA)
Laboratory <https://umaine.edu/ednalab/>`__ and the Data Management Team to facilitate the development of a web application
for the management and tracking of eDNA samples (medna-metadata; `GitHub <https://github.com/Maine-eDNA/medna-metadata>`__).
